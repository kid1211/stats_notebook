# Stat Fundamental

## Mean

## Medium

## Standard Deviation

Average distance between data points and mean

$$std = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=0}^N (x - \overline{x})^2}$$

## Normal distribution

normal distributed = symmetric distributed

68-95-99.7 
> 68 percent of the data points lies in one standard deviation range on both side

## z-score

Z-score are a measure of the number of standard deviation a particular data point is from the mean

$$z-score = \frac{x_i - \overline{x} }{std} $$
$$ x_i = data point $$

## percentile
$$\frac{\text(\# \space of \space values \space below \space x) + 0.5}{\text(total \space \# \space of \space values)} *100 $$



p(1-p)/n

## type of probability

- Objective probability (calculatable)
  - classical probability (coin toss)
  - empirical probability
- subjective probability

## bayes theorem and false positive  <-Need more work->

$$P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)*P(A)}{\sum_{j} P(B|A_j) P(A_j)}$$

## Simple Random Sample

- unbiased sample
- independent data points

Alternative Method

- systematic sample (choose first one then every k unit after) sources of Bias are listed below
    - sampling time
    - sampling location
        
- Opportunity Samples (take first n unit)
